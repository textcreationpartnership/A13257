            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we agrée no better then Papiſtes doo, then were we at a great Iarre: wherefore, I counſell them to plucke the beame out of their owne eyes, and then indeuer to remoue the mote from their brothers ſighte: be they ſo blinde that they ſée not the ciuill warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and that for the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Articles of their Religion?

If they anſweare that the truth of their doctrine is one, albeit in ſome pointes, a few diſſent, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour a little of errours, &amp; ſo aſcribe the blame to men, and not to Religion, it might pleaſe them to alledge the ſame excuſe for our defence.

or Vniuerſall, whiche at all times <note place="margin">Catholike.</note> and in euery place; and with all men hath bene receiued.

            <p>Another ſorte ſet before them ſelfes the Councels &amp; olde Canons: to whom <note place="margin">Councelles and Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> they geue glorious titles, as though thereby the concorde of the Churche might be recouered, but all in vayne: for I doo thinke that no man is now ſo ignorant, but that he doth know, that many Synodes and Councels (I doo ſpeake of them that are not openly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned) haue decreed euen in thinges concerning doctrine, not onely darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but alſo vnlearnedly. Wherfore of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the Prouincials haue bene corrected by the Generall, and yet the Prouinciall hath ſometimes iudged more vprightly then the General. And that the truth was ſo, euery one maye eaſely perceiue, that can compare <hi>Ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I paſſe ouer that thinge whiche the very Hiſtory of thoſe times doth moſte manifeſtly proue, that in thoſe which we may call the beſt times (if they be compared with the latter) there was partly ſuch ambition of the Biſhops, partly ſuche a vaine babling ignorance, and of many of them ſuche an open and deſperate malice, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <note place="margin">Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath bene the preſident of ſome Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Councell is not vnknowen: the which yet a certaine fooliſhe and moſt wicked <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> whoſe impudencie alſo is wel knowen, went about of late to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe before thée (moſt noble Prince) To conclude, what haue not theſe wicked men attempted? and what durſte they not take in hande in theſe Countreis, in the whiche thinges were lawfull that they luſted? Thus muche then for the Councelles.</p>
            <p>Others doo flie vnto the writinges <note place="margin">Thoſe that call moſte for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vvill not allovve the Fathers in all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> of thoſe that they call the auncient and Catholike Fathers, but of ſo greate a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of thoſe, whome I pray you ſhal we chooſe? for we haue but fewe very ancient (that is to ſay vnto the time of <hi>Conſtantine)</hi> emonge whome the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines vndoubtedly were the chiefe: yet are they ſuch as thei that haue the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in moſt reuerence, will not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether agrée vnto, without many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Arius</hi> firſte occupied the age that folowed, vnto the manifeſt fall of the Romaine Empire: and after him <hi>Macedonius,</hi> deniyng the holy Spirit

But chiefly <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and <hi>Eutyches</hi> in the Eaſt, vnto whom the principall &amp; moſte excellent wittes did anſweare and oppoſe them ſelues: neither was there any age that had more plenty of learned Biſhops. The ſecte of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> did occupie the Weſt, whoſe dregges to this daye doo ſtill deſtroy the Churche. Here now I require that without the iniurie of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I maye vtter the matter as it is. Therefore I demaunde this queſtion: <note place="margin">VVhiche of the Fathers ſhall iudge theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies.</note> which one chiefly, or whome of al theſe Fathers, they wil haue for the iudges &amp; deſciders of theſe controuerſies that are at this daye emongſt vs? Firſte of all, thei them ſelues (as beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth them well) refuſe this authoritie: for they crie with one voice, that they doo bring that, whiche the Lorde hath taught: <note place="margin">The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vvill haue the vvoorde of God iudge.</note> and that they will haue their doctrine no farther mainteined then it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the woorde of God written.

call vs to the onely holy Scripture. I will ſaye a little more alſo by the lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of them, that haue ſtudied their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges. Euen at that time in <hi>Grecia,</hi>

an other euell the worſt of al, that like <note place="margin">The thirde euell of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories.</note> as w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> a deadly diſeaſe, all mens mindes were infected, with a meruelous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to turne and tranſforme all the Scriptures into allegories: in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention whereof, euery man thought euery thing in this point to be lawfull to him ſelfe. <hi>Origene</hi> ſurely ſéemeth, to <note place="margin">Origene.</note> haue geuen occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to both thoſe euels, of folowyng the Philoſophers, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the Allegories: whiche was the moſt vnpure writer (as I do take him) that euer did write vppon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: whome though many (as he wel deſerued) did abhorre, yet ſome, of the other ſide, had him in great admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe he was very excellent in the knowledge of the languages, artes and ſciences: and ſome did purſue him rather of enuie then of vpright iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <pb facs="tcp:18639:19"/>
and cauſed the chiefe pointes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion (as of the prouidence &amp; Predeſtination, of frée will, of faithe, and of Iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by frée grace, which were almoſt oppreſſed by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall Gloſes of the <hi>Gretian</hi> biſhops, to be knowen and publiſhed: and yet notwithſtandinge at the ſame time (whiche is wonderfull) prayer to the dead did growe into vſe, and alſo that fooliſh opinion of ſingle life: the which ſhamefull errours <hi>Hyerome</hi> is not <note place="margin">Hierome.</note> aſhamed to defende. And the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Ceremonies did encreaſe, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> complayneth to <hi>Ianuarius:</hi> and many did honour the Monkes as they had bene Angels, eſpecially in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> the moſt ſuperſtitious of all nations: and then began prayers to be made for the dead: &amp; the queſtion of <hi>Plato</hi> of the fire of Purgatorie did <note place="margin">Plato his Purgatory.</note> then ariſe, the whiche yet was not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally receyued in the Church, as the writings of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doo manifeſtly declare. Wherefore to returns to the matter, whom of ſo great a multitude ſhall we eſpecially chooſe for iudges: if
<pb facs="tcp:18639:19"/>
we will heare that <hi>Apoſtata</hi> of whome I haue ſpoken, we muſte chouſe them that liued about the time of <hi>Theodoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> the great. And ſurely I graunt that there was at that time very learned Biſhoppes, but yet dare I affirme this thinge (the whiche I doo proteſt that I doo not ſpeake for the reproche of any) that ſcarcely any of them ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be named which doth not bothe diſſent from him <note place="margin">The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t one from another.</note> ſelfe, &amp; from others in many thinges, and thoſe of no ſmall importance.

But here I knowe what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception he will make: at the leaſte by theſe wryters ſaith he, it ſhal appeare, what was the forme &amp; outwarde face of the Catholike Churche. As though <note place="margin">VVhat neede vve ſeeke for formalitie.</note> this were the chiefe pointe of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, &amp; not rather of the doctrine it ſelfe: or as though at all times, al rites &amp; Ceremonies are to be receiued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, whiche the Apoſtolike Church it ſelfe hath vſed either as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable or neceſſarie for their times:

and as though they were not playne <note place="margin">Buylde thy houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou paynte it.</note> fooles which when the foundations of the houſes were al falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe, would be ſo carefull for building vp the roofe? And what néede many woordes? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that many of you (moſt excellent &amp; noble Lordes) haue in your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance how when we did treate of this matter at Poiſſy (where we had rather a triflynge ſkirmiſhe &amp; alteration then a ſerious and earneſt diſputation) we did thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude in fewe woordes: that the waie and meane to finiſh the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and controuerſies, whiche ſome froward Newtrals and halfefaced me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſome as altogether wicked, and ſome finally we would willingly
<pb facs="tcp:18639:20"/>
admit: whiche coulde be proued either profitable or neceſſarie. What then doo theſe men require any more? aſſuredly moſt noble Prince, they ſéeke this one thinge, that they may bringe into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <note place="margin">Many that ſeeme qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifiers of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies ſeeke to ſpoyle the flocke ſtill vvithout checke.</note> the faithfull Miniſters of God, as men ſeditious, ambitious, and louers of changes, ſuche as woulde haue all thinges new, that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues may ſtill ſpoyle and deſtroy the poore flocke of Chriſte without controlment. For they are like thoſe without doubte of whome the Lorde ſpeaketh: that they neither will enter into the Kingdome of Heauen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, nor ſuffer others to enter in. Thei are the moſt perilous men vndoubtedly, that are ſuffered <note place="margin">VVho are the moſte perilous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies?</note> to liue this day vnder the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne: more daungerous by muche, then the open enemies of the Goſpell, and therefore ought you principally, that are the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones and defenders of the Churches of God, (by the moſt Chriſtian Kinges decrée) to auoyde ſuch men and beware of them: who partely for their bellies ſake, partly for lucre, partly for enuie and malice, partely for fauour of them
<pb facs="tcp:18639:21"/>
whom they flatter, lie in waite to trap you. But I ſée that I haue bene ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what longe in confutinge this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: therefore I doo returne to the matter. For what ſhall we ſay or doo to thoſe, which imagine that the publike errour <note place="margin">Publike er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be the rule of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> muſte be folowed for the rule of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? whiche ſet the bare names of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and cuſtome againſt all reaſons and proufes? whiche finally doo ſticke onely to that one Churche, whiche no <note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts calling one church Vniuerſall, ioygne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.</note> leſſe fooliſhly then falſely they call the Catholike Romiſh Churche (that is to ſay an Vniuerſall particular Church?) ſurely I doo thinke that we muſte let them alone, leaſt we ſhoulde ſéeme to labour to cure madneſſe with reaſon. But now if none of theſe that we haue <note place="margin">God is the Iudge.</note> ſpoken of, may ſitte as Iudges in this cauſe, but rather muſte be iudged of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in what courte then ſhall this great controuerſie be pleaded? Verely before the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeate of God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Then will they ſay, let him be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">VVhere ſhall vvee finde him.</note> downe from his Heauenly palace. Nay why doo they not draw him foorth of theſe their Chancels and holy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?
<pb facs="tcp:18639:21"/>
forſooth becauſe we ſtande in no néede of a dumbe God, that can doo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge but kéepe ſilence, ſuche one as their cruſted God is in the wafer cake: but of that good God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſpeaketh cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainely vnto vs. And I praye you where ſhall we finde him? no <note place="margin">Not in the Boxe. But in the Scriptures.</note> where doubtles ſaue in the writinges of thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, who (as <hi>Peter</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth) haue bene ſtirred vp by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt to ſpeake vnto vs: of thoſe I ſaye vpon whoſe doctrine as vpon the foundation, the Apoſtle crieth that the Churche is builded, euen vppon the bookes of the Apoſtles &amp; the Prophetes whiche are conteined vnder the name of the Olde and new Teſtament. But ſay they, the doubt ſtandeth of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation <note place="margin">Obiection.</note> of this woorde whiche we ſay muſt be ſought at the Church. But firſt of all we muſt agrée whiche is the <note place="margin">Anſvveare.</note> Churche: for the Synagoge of Satan alſo doth abuſe that fayre and beutiful name of the Churche. And howe canſt thou iudge this ſame thinge but by the kinde of the doctrine? And how canſt <note place="margin">The worde is iudge of the Church</note> thou put a difference betwixt the true
<pb facs="tcp:18639:22"/>
doctrine and the falſe, but by the holy Scriptures? As for that ſucceſſion wherein ſome ſette all their ſuccour, it hath ceaſed lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge ago to haue any force or valure, ſeyng this is moſt certaine, that the moſt ignorant and wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue bene the ſucceſſours for many yeares vnto the good and learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: <note place="margin">Succeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of doctrine not of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.</note> and that there doth appeare no ſteppe or token of any lawfull vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Churches now for a longe cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Furthermore we doo require a ſucceſſion of doctrine, not of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, euen of the Propheticall and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall doctrine, ſo that of neceſſitie we muſt runne againe to the bookes of the Prophetes &amp; the Apoſtles, for the proofe of the true ſucceſſion.</p>
            <p>As for the name of Traditions, the <note place="margin">The bare viſar of Tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditions ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not.</note> whiche ſome alſo that feare nothinge more then the triall of the Scripture, doo holde foorth as the terrible face of <hi>Gorgon,</hi> what is it els I pray you, but a bare viſar? for if it be vnderſtande of the doctrine, ſeyng we haue the woorde writen, what néede we any thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writen? for ſurely this vnwriten is
<pb facs="tcp:18639:22"/>
more vncertaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that writen, and no man maye ſéeke a proofe at the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie of that whiche is certaine. How be it here I doo ſée, that many thinges maye be obiected againſt vs. For firſt of all they will ſay, that they vnderſtande by the name of Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <note place="margin">An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> not that whiche was not writen by no man at all, and onely deliuered from hande to hande, but that which though it be not comprehended in thoſe holy bookes which men call Canonicall, yet may be proued by ſome other woorthie wryters: ſo that though at the firſte it was vnwriten, yet may nowe woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely be called writen: and ſuche they call the Traditions of the Apoſtles. Moreouer they will alſo alledge that they vnderſtand by this name Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, certaine plaine and manifeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Chriſtian Faith, which were receiued in the olde Churche, as of Chriſte, how he is of the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the Father: and of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitinge of theſe two natures, and ſuch like: for theſe men vſe to chooſe foorth ſuch thinges as are certaine and moſte
<pb facs="tcp:18639:23"/>
planſible. Now though I ſuppoſe that I haue ſufficiently anſweared vnto theſe thinges heretofore, when I did ſpeake of the Councels and of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Fathers: yet haue I more <note place="margin">The anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveare.</note> to anſweare. For firſt of al, they them ſelues will graunt that all ſuche Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are not to be receiued without exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What rule then ſhal we kéepe herein?

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie had bene of the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our faithe: and bothe parties doo alleadge the Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:

what came to paſſe at the length, but that both parties hauyng on their ſide (as thei ſaid) the Apoſtles, the ſtrife was more ſtyrred.

            <p>Let vs come to the Traditions of <note place="margin">Tvvo good kindes of Traditions.</note> doctrine. They are ſuch, that either to reſiſt the Heretikes, doo make playne
<pb facs="tcp:18639:24"/>
certayne thynges taught in the holy Scriptures, whiche the Heretikes doo vſe to darke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as thei doo the moſt cleare matters: or els they doo ſet foorth ſuche thinges as may be gathered by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paringe of the places together, though they be no where writen in the ſelfe <note place="margin">Euell Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note> ſame woordes. Either are they ſuch, as doo either adde or diminiſhe or alter and change either openly or priuely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinge in the Propheticall and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall writinges. Both thoſe firſt kinde of Traditions (ſuche as are the expoſitions or confeſſions of the faithe of the foure Councels) we are ſo farce from refuſinge of them, that contrary wiſe with open armes (as they ſay) and moſt willinge mindes we doo embrace all ſuche.</p>
            <p>But for the thirde kinde of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions how can we iudge that to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? <note place="margin">The Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that adde to the vvorde.</note> for if any thinge ought to be added to the woorde of God written, it foloweth that all thinges neceſſarie to our Saluation are not writen in the Lawe and the Goſpell. But of the law this neither may nor ought to be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:18639:24"/>
for then God might ſéeme vniuſte for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddyng by plaine woordes any thinge to be added thereunto. Neither doo I here care for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Cabaliſtes, Talmudiſtes,</hi> and all that kinde of ſhameleſſe men. For what can be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more plainely by the Lorde? And howe ſeuerely God hath aduenged this raſhnes when any thing was added not onely in doctrine but alſo in rites, &amp; ceremonies, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Prophetes the interpretours of the lawes, criyng out againſt them, and all the Hiſtorie of the Bible, finally Chriſte him ſelfe is a ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t witneſſe. And ſhall we thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God hath cared leſſe for his Church, or prouided worſe for it, when he ſent <note place="margin">Chriſte and his Apoſtels ſufficient teachers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> his ſonne downe into the Earth? or ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſuppoſe that the Apoſtles were leſſe diligent in this pointe then the Prophetes? <hi>Paule</hi> dothe proteſt vnto the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that he had holden no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge backe, but had declared all the counfaſle of God vnto them, ſo farre foorth at the leaſt as appertained vnto their eternall Saluation. Lette them ſhewe then what <hi>Paule</hi> hath taught
<pb facs="tcp:18639:25"/>
that he hath not writen: or els let them confeſſe the full doctrine of the Goſpell (which he calleth the power of God to ſaluation) to be comprehended in his writinges. But what néede ſo many woordes? when we come to the pointe what can they bringe foorth that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in matters of faith by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and the Euangeliſtes? Peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that the bleſſed virgin Mary was <note place="margin">Obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> not conceiued in Originall ſinne: that ſhe continued all hir life longe a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that children muſte be Baptiſed, that Baptiſme is not to be reiterated, that men muſte faſt in Lente, the holy oyle and chreme, the Holy water, that Altars muſte be hallowed, the Croſſe muſt be woorſhipped, and what ye wil. For they confeſſe that none of thoſe thinges are founde in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. As for Tranſubſtantiation, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confeſſion, praying vnto Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes &amp; purgatorie fire, they haue nowe a good while ſought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Scriptures but all in vaine. But concernynge the maner of conception of the virgine Marie, not onely the holy Scriptures
<pb facs="tcp:18639:25"/>
doo not teache it, but neither any of the auncient writers doo make mention of it. And although I doo willingly and reuerently beleue her perpetuall Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie vnto death, yet (as I once an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared <note place="margin">Anſvveare.</note> to an impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Munke in thy preſence moſt noble Prince) this thing perteineth nothinge to the myſterie of our Saluation. For it is ſufficient for vs to beleue that whiche is done in déede, &amp; declared by the Euangeliſtes that Chriſte our Sauiour was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the holy Ghoſt, and borne of the virgine Mary. And that the infantes ought to be Baptiſed, &amp; that Baptiſme may not be reiterate, we doo not gether of any bare Tradition without the woorde of God. As for thoſe other thinges howe can the holy Scriptures expreſſe them? the which coulde not be eſtabliſhed in the Church, but that the authoritie of the woorde of God muſte firſte be ouerthrowen, as maye be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with moſte euident reaſons. But this muche at this preſent, for we doo not vndertake nowe to declare euery particular matter. Wherefore I come
<pb facs="tcp:18639:26"/>
to that kinde of Traditions, whereby <note place="margin">Traditions that dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe.</note> ſomethinge is taken from the doctrine of the woorde of God written, as when the one parte of the Supper of the Lorde is taken awaye from the Laye men: and when vnto the woordes of <hi>Paule</hi> that calleth the forbiddynge of mariage, and the lawe of forbiddinge of meates, the doctrine of Diuels: there is added the exception of an aduiſed vowe, and an other generall exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche many will haue to be auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in all pointes, <hi>Except it pleaſe our Lorde the Pope othervvaies.</hi> But who <note place="margin">Blaſphemy.</note> I praye you that tendereth the glory of God as he ought to doo, can ſuffer ſuche curſed ſacriledge? for aſſuredly if it be lawfull to take away any thing from that doctrine written, then is it neceſſary that like as theſe men haue compted the doctrine taught by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt a littell before, to be haltyng and vnperfecte, and to wante ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, ſo nowe in other thinges, they may ſay, that it is redoundant &amp; ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous: neither of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which two things any good mans eares can heare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:18639:26"/>
great offence. But yet they ſaye, that no man can denie, but that the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the lawe are altogether already taken away. Howbeit we doo not treate nowe of the rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; but of the very ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the woorſhip of God, whereof though we doo iudge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ceremonies of old to haue bene a portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet ſerueth this nothing to defende their bolde ſacrilege. For what meruell is it, though the lawe whiche was made to ſhadowe thoſe things whiche were hoped for to come at the time apointed, did vade and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away at the light and ſight of the ſame? but if theſe men bringe againſt vs that the loue feaſtes called <hi>Agape.</hi> &amp; that Apoſtolicall decrée of things offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to idols &amp; the ſtrangeled, was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away by commen conſent, &amp; the anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge Apoſtolical which we haue now aboliſhed. I doo anſwere againe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe are externall thinges of which we ſhal diſpute afterwarde. But this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude for certaine, that the doctrine of Saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conteyned in Gods woorde, muſt be mainteyned ſafe &amp; ſounde, not
<pb facs="tcp:18639:27"/>
onely in the whole ſubſtance but in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery the leaſt and ſmaleſt parte therof without addition or diminution.</p>
            <p>Now why ſhould we once name or <note place="margin">VVicked Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> make mention of that thirde kinde of Traditions, which doo either ſhake the fundations of the Saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Chriſt, eyther ouerthrowe the thynges that are builte vpon that foundation. Such as are the Supremacie of the Biſhop of Rome, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praying to ſainctes, prayer for the dead, the makyng and the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippyng of Idols, the Magiſtrall and Doctorall determinations (as thei call them) of frée wil, of merite, of pardons and of ſuch other filthineſſe, the which thinges ſéeinge they coulde neuer be eſtabliſhed ſo longe as the authoritie of the Heauenly doctrine ſtoode vnſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his full force, ſo are they ouer impudent, whiche doo thinke that theſe thinges maye be eſtabliſhed, eyther by the falſe forged title of the Church, or by the preſcription &amp; length of time.</p>
            <p>Goe to then, lette vs conclude this <note place="margin">All Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not alvvaies to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved.</note> place, that they are farre deceyued which thinke that the Catholike rites
<pb facs="tcp:18639:27"/>
are of neceſſitie to be receyued, for there be alſo ſome Catholike errours, whiche haue crepte into the Churche, partely by the ignoraunce of many of the Biſhops, partly by their neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, partly by their blinde zeale and apiſhe imitation of others, and alſo by theyr ambition &amp; couetouſnes, but chiefly by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſte gréedy deſire of honour which was in the Romiſh Biſhoppes. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore wheras in the appointing of <note place="margin">Externall rites and ceremonies whiche are perticular may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaies chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and muſte be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed vvhen they become ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious or Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous.</note> rites &amp; orders, wiſe men alwaies haue had regard to the time, place, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: who dothe not ſée, that they are moſte fooliſhe, who in theſe kinde of thinges, when the circumſtances are changed, will not onely haue nothyng chaunged, but alſo ſuch thinges as are for iuſte cauſes aboliſhed, either by the continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of time or other waies, yet becauſe they are au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient, thei wil haue them to be againe reuoked? but what ſhall we ſaye of thoſe thinges that are degenerate into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt manifeſt mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Idolatrie? the whiche in that moſt curſed time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God was angry with our ſinnes did preuaile, though a fewe in the beginninge (but in vaine)
<pb facs="tcp:18639:28"/>
did reſiſte, the whiche thinges finally though they were not at this preſent vtterly polluted, yet are they ſuch, as can ſcarſely (no not all) be kepte pure any longe ſpace.</p>
            <p>But here cometh to my minde the <note place="margin">Politike Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> voice of theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues moſt witty of all others, which thinke that the Churche ought to be reformed but not tranſformed. And they call the reformation, a reſtorynge agayne of thoſe rites, whiche were in vſe in the floriſhyng time of the Church, as they terme it (takinge awaye ſome thinges which by the wickednes of times haue bene abuſed) the whiche except we doo receyue, they crie that the Churche is tranſformed, and depriued vtterly of hir beautie and comelineſſe. Surely their woordes haue a greate ſhewe and a beautifull, but it procedeth from the ſpirite of Satan, whiche then bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe, when we come to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is nothyng ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that they dare not couer vnder the colour of antiquitie and obtrude it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs for comely and beautifull. Thoſe Rapſodies moſte vayne and fooliſhe
<pb facs="tcp:18639:28"/>
written of theſe matters by <hi>G. Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> that bablynge <hi>Apoſtata</hi> (with whoſe name I woulde not defile theſe papers) doo declare theſe matters.</p>
            <p>How be it I folowynge the example of Kinge <hi>Ezekiah</hi> (ſo greatly commended) had much rather to imitate ſuch, which doo Iudge that the offence and dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger that lieth in the high way, ought to be aboliſhed and taken away, though at ſometimes there hath bene or maye be ſome vſe therof: rather then to appoint monitores to ſtande by, which may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the paſſengers leſt they at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares doo fall into ſuche perilles. For what if they that are admoniſhed doo not obey? or the Monitors doo not their office? Moreouer beſides that in many of their ſuppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s I doo not onely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them, but I doo vtterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre them, ſo in their propoſition I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not agrée vnto them. For if we ſéeke <note place="margin">The chiefe patterne of the Church is in Chriſte and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</note> the moſt beautifull face of the Church &amp; moſt perfect patterne, I ſuppoſe that is it, which was not onely begonne (as theſe men imagine) or ſhadowed out with the firſte pouncinge or paintinge draughtes, by the Apoſtles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:18639:29"/>
(which were the chiefe workemaiſters y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church hath had or ſhall haue hereafter) but portered foorth moſte beautifully &amp; moſt dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, with moſt liuely colours: from the which the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that thou ſtrayeſt, ſo farre wide wandereſt thou more &amp; more from the rule of thy worke. And after what ſort that forme was, &amp; why I ſhould thinke that we ought to ſéeke it no where els, ſaue onely in the writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles &amp; the Apoſtolical Hiſtorie writen by <hi>Luke</hi> (whome I doo graunt to haue <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie and lies of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtes Churche.</note> painted this foorth moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly) not onely the contrarietie emonges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pel me vnto it, but alſo to ſpeake plainly, the fonde vanitie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which haue either perticularly recited or wholly collected y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions (as they terme them) ſuche as thoſe fooliſhe &amp; moſt falſe deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of them attributed vnto <hi>Clement,</hi> &amp; thoſe that thei call the Canons of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles whiche haue bene a greate while ago counted emonge the bookes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> are to be reiected. But if ſome will obiect that al thinges are not written by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles and by <hi>Luke:</hi> I praye you why doo they

thinke ſo, becauſe there be but fewe <note place="margin">Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented him ſelfe vvith fevv ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies, and ſo did his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</note> thinges conteined in their writinges? Nay would to God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they which boſte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be the ſucceſſors of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles could haue contented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with this ſmal nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. For God would neuer haue had the rites &amp; ceremonies of Moiſes aboliſhed to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhuld be put in their places: &amp; if it were not lawful to imitate the Iewes, <note place="margin">Ievves nor Idolaters may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved.</note> much more vnlawful is it to folow the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the which thing if the Ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Biſhops had reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had neither ſwarued ſo ſoone nor ſo ſhamefully, firſt into vaine ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies &amp; triflinge Liturgies, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> into manifeſt ſuperſtition, &amp; laſt of all euen degenerate into an <hi>Atheiſme.</hi> For <hi>Paule</hi> woorthely doth call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Atheiſts</hi> &amp; Godleſſe, whiche doo not woorſhip the onely true God as he ought to be woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. But ſhal we ſay that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did not properly treate of this argument &amp; matter? Nay certainely it were a certaine kinde of impietie, to thinke that the holy Ghoſt had not ſo great regard of the Church as was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: and this dare I affirme that he

which readeth dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the Hiſtory of <hi>Luke,</hi> and the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, ſhall therby very wel learne, not only the chiefe pointes of the Eccleſiaſticall <note place="margin">Folowe the Scriptures and thou ſhalte not neede vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note> order, but alſo almoſt euery part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſo that no place néede to be lefte at all, to thoſe vnwritten Traditions. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng how ſo euer this be, ſeinge we ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de néede of a moſt perfect diſtinction to diſcerne the diuerſitie of thoſe infinite Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, by what rule <note place="margin">By vvhat rule ſhall vve trie the diuerſitie of Traditions and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</note> I praye you ſhall we trie them? for we haue declared that there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient argument concluded, neither by the Antiquitie nor Authoritie of the writers, neither by the multitude of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by whome thei haue bene allowed: Therfore ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de we néede of the woorde of God onely, euen of that woorde of God (I ſay) whiche is publiſhed by the Prophetes and the Apoſtles, and as it were, ſette foorth in publike Tables: wherby we may diſſeuer the holy from the vnholy, the profitable from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and hurtfull, the neceſſarie from the ſuperfluous, and to eſtabliſhe thoſe Traditions by good reaſon that are thus diſſeuered.

be neceſſary y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the light of Gods woorde <note place="margin">Gods vvoorde is the touche ſtone of doctrine.</note> writen muſt be our guide, to iudge the rites &amp; Ceremonies: howe muche more neceſſarie is it vnto the knowledge of the doctrine it ſelfe, that the ſame light muſte be our guide, in the whiche do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine men are much more blinded and doo erre with farre more daunger? For if nothing, as we haue declared hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be folowed of vs in doctrine, but that either is expreſſed by playne woordes in the Scriptures of God, or els is gathered neceſſarily by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferringe together of places, howe can I beware of the falſe Prophetes, onles I doo compare the doctrine pronounced by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with the woorde of God it ſelfe?

of the ſame woordes, and thoſe moſte fewe in number (that is to ſay) this is my Bodie, this is my Bloud, doo finde out Tranſubſtantiation, others Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, others onely a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Coniunction. Finally ſaye theſe mediatours, theſe halters in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that would ſéeme to appeaſe the controuerſies, when the controuerſie falleth, not of the woorde, but of the ſence, whether ſhall we runne rather then to the Churche, to the writinges of the Catholike fathers, that were of ſounde iudgement, finally to the true and lawfull Councels?

            <p>And the Godly learned Fathers would haue their writings none other waies to be redde, neither with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condition, but that they ſhould be examined by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule of the woorde wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Finally this is not the office of the Councels to make any newe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but to confirme by Gods woorde that which is already made and ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him: thoſe Synodes that haue done otherwaies, are the chaires of the wicked and the ſeates of the ſcorners, the whiche we are commaunded to flie that we may be bleſſed. Moreouer if <note place="margin">Doctors and Councels, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſo that vve do iudge by the vvorde.</note> there be any doubte of the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the woorde writen, I doo not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be witneſſes as I haue ſaid, but I ſuppoſe that firſt of all we muſte diligently diſcerne the true Churche from the Synagoge of Satan: the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are not ſuſpected in Faithe nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, from ſuch as either are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> manifeſtly without knowledge, or
<pb facs="tcp:18639:32"/>
Heretikes, or otherwiſe ſuſpected: and the lawfull and vndoubted faithfull Councels, from the Synodes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticles aſſembled againſt Chriſtes truthe: finally the true bookes muſt be warely Iudged from the forged and counterfaite.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges beinge determined, <note place="margin">God is only iudge by his vvorde.</note> then doo I ſaye, that all theſe are to be hearde, not as iudges (for God is only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge by his written woorde) but as witneſſes cited and ſworne, and that certainely, after the ſame maner as witneſſes are heard by ſkilfull Iudges in publike controuerſies: euen ſo vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they ſhew the cauſes &amp; reaſons of their teſtimonies, cauſes I ſay not borowed any where els, but foorthe of the ſame woorde, of the interpretation wherof the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is moued. For <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> renouncinge humaine reaſon ſaith very wel: by the holy Scriptures we walke much more ſafely, the which <note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> beinge ſhadowed with borowed ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, when we wil ſearch them, either that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth foorth whiche is without controuerſie, or if it haue any doubte, it may be determined by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:18639:32"/>
by the gatheringe and finding of teſtimonies &amp; witneſſes of euery ſide. Thus ſaith he, and that very wel. For if we muſt onely haue our wiſdome by the onely writen woorde, then may not the interpretation of this woorde be fetched any other where: For as the ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, ſo hath the holy ſpirite tempered &amp; ordered the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> that thyng which is ſpoken in ſome place ſomethinge darkly, in ſome other place is declared more plainly.</p>
            <p>Finally what other man ſhal we fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <note place="margin">VVho ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be folovved then Chriſt and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. Heretikes ouercome by the Scriptures.</note> then Chriſt him ſelf and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? and Chriſte did confute Satan abuſinge the Scriptures, by no other meanes but by the ſame Scriptures. The Apoſtles confirme their doctrine by the writings of the Prophets: And the Iewes of <hi>Beraea</hi> are prayſed, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had hearde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine taught by <hi>Paule,</hi> they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared it with the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges of the Prophetes, to trie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe thinges were ſo or no. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely the Councels of Nice did with none other weapon cut the throte of <hi>Arrius,</hi> nor that of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantinople, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonius,</hi> nor the <hi>Epheſine Neſtorius,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18639:33"/>
nor the <hi>Chalcedonian Eutiches,</hi> nor <hi>Auguſtine, Pelagius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Donatus:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that counte the Scripture ſo doubtfull and darke, that it ſtandeth néede to haue light brought thereunto ſome other wayes, are woorthie of all good men to be ſpitted vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and vtterly to be abhorred.</p>
            <p>Yet doo I not diſprayſe the writings <note place="margin">Doctors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved of God.</note> of the Doctors and their interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeinge that he that hath ordeined paſtors and doctors to the edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the bodie, hath Authoriſed them bothe by woorde and by writinges to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretate the ſame: but I declare howe farre we muſt ſticke vnto them, euen ſo farre as they doo bringe nothinge of their owne, no not at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time when as the controuerſie is of the ſence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any place of Scripture, but that they by the Scriptures doo interpretate the Scriptures, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the proportion of Faithe: the whiche who ſo dothe, whether he be newe or olde, a Priuate perſon or Publike officer in the Churche, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he come alone or with many, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be an olde man or a yong man,
<pb facs="tcp:18639:33"/>
let hym bee heard. For though order <note place="margin">Order is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but not ſo that we binde Gods grace to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone &amp; place, but meaſure all by the rule of gods word</note> muſt nedes be kepte in the Churche of God, yet are no men ſo farre deceiued, as thei that dooe binde the grace of the holie ghoſt, to certaine places and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones. For who murdered the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes? Who crucified Chriſte? Thei vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie, that ſhould haue been the chief pillers of true religion. Therfore doeth not the Prophete, ſende the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, to thoſe godleſſe Prieſtes, but to the Lawe and the Prophettes. Neither aſſuredlie hath the condicion of the Churche, a long while béen any otherwaies, whiles the corner ſtone hath been reproued, by the verie chiefe builders, and Antichriſt hath ſitten in the temple and place of God hym ſelf. What ſhall we now conclude? Vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that by the woorde of God, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies muſte bee ended: and that it is neceſſarie, that the falſe and forged <note place="margin">The worde of God ende of all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies.</note> woorde, bee iudged from the true, like as alſo the true churche, from the falſe and adulterous: and the Synodes and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celles, gouerned by the holie ghoſt, from thoſe wherein Sathan was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidente:
<pb facs="tcp:18639:34"/>
Finallie, the truthe from lyes and errours, by Gods holie woorde. For we muſte beleue, that in thynges concernyng our ſaluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we haue no <note place="margin">The want of the word the original of all errours.</note> where els the truthe reueiled. The whiche thynges beyng true, if follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that that thyng is moſte certain, whiche I ſaid in the beginning, moſte noble Prince, to bee the originalle, whence all theſe euils did flowe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in our fathers daies, the churche was almoſte oppreſſed, and therefore that this onelie is the waie and mean, to raiſe it vp again, if by the pure word of God, theſe controuerſies maie bee decided.</p>
            <p>For ſo will it come to paſſe, that of the moſte parte of thoſe thynges, there ſhal bee no queſtion at all: aboute the whiche, yet at this daie verie many, partly by ignoraunce, partly through malice and frowardneſſe, dooe moſte ſtubbernely contende and ſtriue. And thoſe thynges, whiche ſhall ſeme to be ſtaied, by the teſtimonies of ſcriptures, if thei be iudged not by cuſtome (which when it departeth from the woorde,
<pb facs="tcp:18639:34"/>
hath no aucthoritie at all in matters of religion) neither by the bare aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of certaine menne, bee thei newe or olde, but by the compariſon of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together, all the interpretacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng examined by the proporcion and rule of faithe: then finallie, no thyng ſhal bee founde ſo harde, that ſhall not eaſily be vnderſtand, nothing ſo darke that ſhall not be made cleare, nothyng ſo doubtfull, that ſhall not bee made plaine and euidente. But who ſhall binde men to this order: who ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte this action, and who finallie ſhall treate theſe thynges by common auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie? It is not our purpoſe, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute theſe matters at this preſente, although whiles I often and many ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes dooe thinke of this matter, ſome thynges dooe come into my mynde, of the whiche it maie be, that I ſhal haue occaſion to ſpeake at ſome other time. Now lette vs treate, that wee haue in hande.</p>
            <p>Seyng then all theſe controuerſies, muſt be diſcuſſed by gods holy worde, I ſuppoſe that this thing, ought chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:18639:35"/>
to be prouided for, that ſeing all can not haue the knowledge, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande the woorde of God, in thoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <note place="margin">A good and true copy of the ſcriptures very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> languages, the Hebrue and the Greke (whiche were to be wiſhed) that there ſhould be ſome true and apt tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlacion, of the olde and newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente made: the whiche diuers haue alredie laboured to bryng to paſſe, but no manne hath yet ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly enough performed it. For the olde tranſlacion, <note place="margin">The old texte</note> (whoſe ſo euer it is) although it ought not to bee condemned, yet is it founde bothe obſcure, and vnperfit and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and alſo falſe in many places, to ſpeake nothing of an infinite varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, almoſte of the copies. The whiche text therfore, for good cauſe many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and learned menne, haue laboured to amende, but not with like ſucceſſe. And yet how neceſſary a thing this is, <note place="margin">The learned Grecian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did not attain to the Hebrue veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> whoſoeuer ſhall read thoſe moſte lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned writers of the Grecians, and ſhall compare their interpretacions (which are many tymes farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the purpoſe) with the Hebrue veritie, he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it with greate ſorowe. And the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:18639:35"/>
ſame euill was not onelie hurtefull, emonges the Latine writers, but alſo the ignoraunce of the Greke tongue, <note place="margin">The Latin writers wer troubled for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue &amp; greke.</note> where with many of them were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: whiles thei did depende of the common tranſlacion, thei often times ſeke a knot in the Ruſhe (according to the prouerhe) and fall into moſte foule errours.</p>
            <p>This cauſe therfore hath moued me to compare moſte dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie, the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of copies, and to weigh the ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, of the moſte part of the learned men, eſpecially of theim that this age hath brought forthe ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the languages, who are moe in nomber doubtles, and better learned then the Churche hath had, ſince the time of the Apoſtles: and ſo to eaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And that it might be doen with the more profite, I haue alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded annotacions, in the whiche I haue alſo conferred together, the diuerſitie of interpretacions, and as muche as I could, I haue laboured to make plain and euidente, the ſenſe and meauyng,
<pb facs="tcp:18639:36"/>
of all the moſte darke places.</p>
            <p>But when as I did ſee, that thicke woorke (and very painfull, as I muſte nedes by experience confeſſe it) growe ſo greate, when it came againe to the Printyng, that many could not haue the commoditie of it, I cauſed it to bee Printed alone, without thoſe annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions: In the place whereof yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that I haue ſette ſuche thynges, the which (if I could haue doen them, as thei oughte to haue been dooen) I would not doubt to commende them, not onely as profitable, but alſo as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie neceſſarie.</p>
            <p>There bee twoo kindes of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: The one is of that ſorte, which <note place="margin">Two kinds of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> doe not conſider properly the thyng it ſelf, and what is ſpoken, but take in hande to declare, with what woordes any thyng is ſpoken, chaungyng one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the phraſes, &amp; the maner of ſpeache. The whiche kinde of interpretacion, although it can ſcarſly, no not at all rightly be performed of hym, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth not the thyng it ſelf, yet ſtandeth it in the woordes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18639:36"/>
The other kinde is of them, whiche dooe declare the thyng and matter it <note place="margin">Caluine.</note> ſelf with many woordes, and geue the reaſons. In the whiche kinde of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretacion (in my iudgement, and as I ſuppoſe in the iudgemente of all the learned, that haue read his bokes) that noble Ihon Caluine, that man of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed memorie, and my father in. Chriſte ſhal be founde (ſo that no manne enuy my ſaiyng) farre to haue paſſed and excelled all the writers, bothe did and new. Therefore, though I ſome times in certaine places, not in any poinct of his doctrine (the whiche I haue alwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes marked, to be moſte pure &amp; ſounds in his writynges, as in any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter beſides) but in the explicaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of certaine places, doe diſſent from hym: yet dooe, I iudge of his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, that which <hi>Cicero</hi> did iudge of <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> commentaries, in a kind of writing farre vnlike (that is to ſaie) that he made all menne of any witte, affraied to write after him. And would to God that wée, that are miniſters in Chriſtes churche, through the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <pb facs="tcp:18639:37"/>
of God (and I my ſelf eſpecially) might be occupied in learnyng and teaching rather then in writing. But what ſhal we doe? The importunitie of certaine of our aduerſaries (againſt whoſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes it is neceſſarie, that the louers of the truthe, by all meanes oppoſe them ſelues) doeth partly driue vs herevnto, leaſt the ſimple bee trapped at vnwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: and partly Charitie, whiche doeth admoniſhe vs, to applie to the profite of our brethren, what ſoeuer we haue receiued. Now verie many haue ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto me (either becauſe it is ſo, or becauſe I am deceiued) to faile muche in this, that in the particular reherſals of the Euangelicall, and Appoſtolical <note place="margin">The cheife points of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and the order of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are to be obſerued.</note> hiſtorie, in to that whiche is diuided; doubtles by moſte diuine arte, thei do not marke nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider to what poinct chiefly of chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euery thing ought to bee referred: muche leſſe alſo in thoſe moſte graue diſputacions, in the Epiſtles of thapoſtles, whiche are written (as is moſte true) with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellente order, do thei co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, what is the ſtate of theim, what is the order: or
<pb facs="tcp:18639:37"/>
finally, what is the ende and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: herof commeth it that in ſome of their writinges, neither hed nor foote appereth many tymes. And thei lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng the ſcope and purpoſe, wander to certaine notes and obſeruacions, confuſedly and without order heaped together: So that in many places of moſte importaunce, no regarde is had to the ſentence it ſelf.</p>
            <p>This is the cauſe that in Paule cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (who yet had as great a ſkill &amp; iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement in writing as any writer that <note place="margin">Paul of moſt diuine iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath written moſt orderly.</note> euer did write) vnlearned and vnſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men haue dreamed hertofore to be infinitie <hi>Hiperbatons</hi> and <hi>Anantapo dotons,</hi> ſentences and wordes not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering out to an other, and haue in their commentaries vpon him, euery where to their owne ſhame ſtill incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the ſame: in ſo muche that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this moſte excellent, declarer of gods ſecrets, was no more knowen in the ſcholes, then if he had lefte no monumentes nor writinges, yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did flye from him as from a rocke, for feare of ſhipwrake. Wherfore that
<pb facs="tcp:18639:38"/>
I might fynde a remedy for this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, I haue endeuored my ſelfe as much as in me lyeth, to note the brefe <note place="margin">Bezas anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> ſummaries of doctrine in the hiſtorie matters: that who ſo euer ſhall ſaile as it were in that ſee, maye marke a hauen before their eies where vnto thei may directe their courſe. And in the Epiſtles I haue labored that the ſcope and order of arguments, and the methode and all other thinges beinge ſet in their places, the natiue expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions maye be knowen. And if God <note place="margin">His expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and the hard wordes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But now when peace is reſtored, you haue greate nede of a ſpirituall conſtancie, and an inuincible power and force of faithe, that this woorke that you haue begonne, maie bee finiſhed with your euerlaſtyng laude and praiſe. And the Lorde will miniſter this vnto you, by the continuall and diligente hearyng of his woorde, and meditatyng of the ſame.

               <p>For Chriſte hath taken vpon hym, and borne the ſinnes of the worlde, he hath ſatiſfied the iuſtice of God: God therefore for his onely Chriſtes ſake, <note place="margin">Iuſtice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to vs.</note> (who ſuffred death, and roſe againe) is mercifull to our ſinnes, not imputing

               <p>For wee teache, that God geneth a <note place="margin">God rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth our good deedes.</note> large rewarde to theim that doe good, accordyng to the Prophettes ſaiyng: Refraine thy voice from wepyng, for <note place="margin">Iere. xxxi.

Furthermore, there be many thynges vnmete to bee preſented to God, and ſundrie thynges are founde vnperfite, euen in the ſainctes deédes or workes. But becauſe, God receiueth them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his fauour, and loueth the workers for Chriſt his ſake, he geueth them the rewarde, whiche he promiſed theim.

For Paule ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie and brieflie declaryng, what wee ought to thinke of the miniſters of the newe Teſtamente, or of the Chriſtian churche, and how we ought to eſteme theim, ſaieth: Let men ſo thinke of vs, as of the miniſters of Chriſte, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſers of the ſecretes of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">i. Cor. iiii.</note> the Apoſtle would, that we iudge of miniſters none otherwiſe, then as of miniſters.

In an other place <note place="margin">Luke. xii.</note> of the Goſpell we reade, of a faithfull and wiſe ſeruaunte, whom his Lorde appoincted ouerſeer of his houſehold, to geue meate to theim in due ſeaſon.

               <p>Here haue wée occaſion miniſtered,
<pb facs="tcp:18639:107"/>
to ſpeake ſomewhat of the aucthoritie and office of churche miniſters: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">The auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> ſome haue with muche labour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and haue made ſubiecte vnto their power, all the chiefeſt thinges in the yearth, cleane contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente of the Lorde, whiche forbad his diſciples, to ſtriue for chiefe rule, and highlie commended humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <note place="margin">

                  </note> all thynges are ſubiecte, to Chriſte the Lorde of all, as he teſtifieth, ſaiyng: Power is geuen to me in heauen and in yearth: And againe, I am the firſte and the laſte, beholde I liue worlde without ende, and haue the Keyes of hell and of death. Alſo, he hath the keis of Dauid, whiche openeth, and no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhutteth, ſhutteth and no manne ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. This power the Lorde kepeth to himſelf, and geueth to none other, that he might ſtande idley, beholdyng his miniſters, while thei doe woorke. For Eſaie writeth, I will laye vpon his <note place="margin">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18639:107"/>
And againe, whoſe rule ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vpon his ſhoulders: but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth, and ſtill vſeth his power, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng all. Moreouer, there is an other power, belongyng to the office or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, <note place="margin">what powre god geueth to miniſters.</note> limited of hym, who hath full and abſolute aucthoritie, that power is rather to be likened to ſeruice, then to rule. For ſome lorde geueth to his ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, power ouer his houſe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal <note place="margin">A pretie ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.</note> he geueth his keies alſo, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he maie let in or ſhutte out of the houſe, whom the Lorde will, either to be lette in, or ſhutte out. Accordyng to this power, the miniſter dooeth by his office, that whiche he is commaunded to doe of his Lorde, who ratifieth and alloweth his dooynges, and will haue his miniſters deede, to be eſtemed and acknowledged as his owne. And this is the meanyng of thoſe ſentences in the Goſpell, I will geue thée the keies <note place="margin">Math. xvi.</note> of the kyngdome of heauen: what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou ſhalt binde or loſe in yearth, ſhal be bounde or looſed in heauen. <note place="margin">Ihon. xx.</note> Alſo whoſe ſynnes ye remitte, thei are remitted vnto theim, and whoſe

ſynnes ye retaine, thei are retained. But excepte the miniſter ſhall doe all thynges, as he is commaunded of his Lorde, if he paſſe the limites of faithe, truely God diſaloweth his dooynges. Therefore the Eccleſiaſtical power of Churche miniſters, is that function, whereby miniſters dooe in deede rule the Churche of God, but yet dooe all thinges therein, as the Lorde hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincted in his woorde: And beyng ſo dooen, the faithefull accompte then as doen of the lorde hymſelf.

were gouerned by the common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of thelders: but after eche maner thought thoſe, whom he baptiſed to bée his owne, and not Chriſtes, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créed, that one of the Elders ſhould bée choſen, and preferred aboue the other, to whom all the care of the Churche, ſhould appertain, and by whoſe wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, all occaſions of ſchiſmes might bée taken awaie. Yet Ierome boaſteth not of this Decree, as though it were godlie, for immediately he addeth: As Elders knowe, by the cuſtome of the Churche, that thei are ſubiecte to hym, who is their ouerſeer, ſo let Biſſhops knowe that thei, more by cuſtome, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Lordes ordinaunce, are in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter auctoritie then the elders, and that the Churche ought to bee ruled in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by other, as well as by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus muche Ierome. Therefore no man by right maie lette vs to retourne, to that olde gouernement of God his church, and to receiue it before the cuſtome of manne.</p>
               <p>There are ſundrie dueties belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to miniſters, whiche notwithſtanding <note place="margin">what the due<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are.</note>

for the moſt part, maie be reſtrained to twoo, wherein all other dueties are comprehended. The one is preachyng of Chriſte his Goſpell: the other is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteryng the Sacramentes. For it is the miniſters duetie, to aſſemble the holy congregacion, &amp; in it to expounde the worde of God, and to applie all his doctrine, to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of his chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, that thoſe thynges, whiche are taught, maie profitte the hearers, and edifie the faithful. It belongeth to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to teache the vnlearned, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them, and to pricke forward thoſe that geue ouer, or walke ſlowlie in the waie of the Lorde.

the right vſe of theim, and to prepare all menne with wholſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to the worthie receiuyng ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to kepe the faithfull in holie vnitie, to forbidde Schiſmes and Hereſies, to inſtruct the rude, to declare to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregacion the neceſſitie of the poore, to viſite the ſicke, and thoſe that be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſundrie temptacions, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and keepe theim in the waie of life: Furthermore, to prouide for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike praier, in the tyme of neceſſitie, and for faſting, that is to ſaie, holie ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence: and with all diligence to loke to all thynges, that belongeth to the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quilitie, peace, and ſauegard of the Churche.

For tha poſtle witneſſeth, that he had <note place="margin">ii. Cor. x.</note> power geuen hym in the Churche of God to edifie, and not to deſtroie. The Lorde hymſelf ſaieth, that the Darnell <note place="margin">Math. xiii.</note> in the Lorde his lande, ſhould not bee rooted out, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is daunger, leaſt the Wheate alſo be plucked vp there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall.</p>
               <p>But wee deteſte the <hi>Donatiſtes</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, <note place="margin">Miniſters, albeit they be euill ſhoulde be hearde.</note> who thincke preachyng and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterynge the Sacramentes, to bée of efficacie and vertue, or not of effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, accordyng to the good or euill life of miniſters.

And this ſo greate a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite is renewed ſo ofte, as the ſupper of the Lorde is celebrated. For he ſaid, dooe this in the remembraunce of me. It is alſo confirmed vnto vs, in this Supper (leaſte wee ſhould wauer in faithe) that the Lordes bodie in deede, was deliuered for vs, and his bloude ſhedde for the remiſſion of our ſinnes. And truely that to the outwarde yies, is by the miniſter, repreſented in the Sacramente, and as it were laied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our face, which inwardly is doen after an inuiſible ſorte, by the holie ghoſte: Outwardlie, breade is offered by the miniſter, &amp; the wordes of Chriſt <note place="margin">The ſigne &amp; the thinge ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified.</note> are heard, Take, eate, this is my body, take deuide it betwixt you, Drinke ye

For the fleſhe and bloud of Chriſt, is true meate &amp; drinke to eternall life. And Chriſte hym ſelf in that he was deliuered for our ſakes and is our ſauiour, is that principall chiefe thyng of the ſupper, neither ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer we any other thyng to be put in his ſtede.

For he ſaieth, I am the breade of life, he that commeth to me ſhall not hunger, and he that beleueth in me, ſhall neuer thirſte: And againe, he that ſhall eate me, he ſhall alſo liue through me, and abide in me, and I in hym. By this it is manifeſte, that we vnderſtande not, by ſpiritual meate, I knowe not what maner of imagined meate, but the ſelf <note place="margin">The recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of chriſt his bodie.</note> ſame bodie of the Lorde, whiche was crucified for vs, whiche notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng is receiued of the faithefull, not bodilie, but ſpiritually by faithe. And in this matter wée followe in all poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, the doctrine of our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, whiche he taught. This eating <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ihon. vi.</hi> what eating of Chriſte is neceſſarie to ſaluation.</note> of the fleſhe, and drinkyng of the bloud of the Lorde, is ſo neceſſarie to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that without it, no manne can be ſaued.

               <p>Beſide the former ſpirituall eating, <note place="margin">A ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall eatinge of Chriſte.</note> there is alſo a Sacramental eating of the Lordes bodie, whereby the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is not onelye ſpiritually and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly made partaker of the true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloode of the Lorde, but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly alſo by comming to the Lords table, receaueth the viſible Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the bodie and bloud of the Lorde.

For, while we liue, fayth continually increaſeth in vs. And he that outwardlie receaueth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes with a true faith, euen he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18639:123"/>
not the ſigne onely, but enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the thynge it ſelf alſo, ment by the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as we haue declared. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, he obeieth the Lorde his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitucion and commaundemente, and with a cherefull harte giueth thankes, for his and all mankindes rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, remembryng faithefullie the Lordes death, and witneſſyng the ſame before the churche, of whoſe bodie he is a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. It is confirmed or ſealed alſo, to theim that receiue the Sacramentes, that the bodie of Chriſt was betraied, and his bloud ſhedde, not onely gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for men, but alſo particulerly for euery faithfull receiuer, whoſe meate <note place="margin">Note.</note> and drinke it is, to life euerlaſtyng.</p>
               <p>But he that without faithe, cometh to the holie Table of the Lorde, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth <note place="margin">Vnfaithfull receauers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue but the bare ſignes.</note> the Sacramente onely, and not the thyng mente by the Sacramente, whereby commeth life and ſaluacion: and ſuche eate vnworthely of the lorde his table. Now thei that eate vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely <note place="margin">Vnworthie receauers.</note> of the Lordes breade, and drinke of his Cuppe vnworthely, are giltie of the bodie and bloude of the Lorde, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
<pb facs="tcp:18639:124"/>
and drinkyng their owne dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion. For when thei come not with a true faithe, thei doe ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, and like vilaines deſpiſe the death of Chriſte, and therefore eate and drincke their owne damnacion.</p>
               <p>Wherefore wée dooe not ſo knitte <note place="margin">Chriſte his preſence in his Supper.</note> and ioigne together, the Lords his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood, with the bread and wine, that we affirme the bread to be the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſte, but after a Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall maner.

The bodie of Chriſt is in heauen, on the right hande of his father: Wee muſt therefore lifte vp our hartes, and not fire &amp; ſet our mindes on the bread.

all to this ende, that ſeeyng God hath ſufficiently declared his wille, by his Prophettes and Apoſtles, yea, by the monthe of his derely beloued ſoonne, our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſte, wee ought ſo to honour and reuerence, this holie woorde of God, that we adde nothyng thereto of our owne, but wholie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ſelues, to the rewle preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto vs therein. And for that the Romiſhe Churche (leauyng the vſe and cuſtome of the primitiue Church) hath broughte in newe commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and a newe maner of ſeruing God, we thinke it moſte reaſonable to preferre the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundmentes of God, (whiche is the truthe it ſelf) to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

cauſe, why the handes of hangmen, haue been ſo ofte embrued, with the bloodde of your poore ſubiectes: Who ſparyng neither life nor gooddes, for maintainaunce of this Confeſſion of faithe, haue manifeſtly declared to all the worlde, that thei wer moued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by a farre mightier ſpirit, then any ſpirit of manne, whiche is more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of quietnes and commoditie, then of the honour and glorie of God. And therefore, accordyng to the goodneſſe and clemencie, whiche your Maieſtie promiſeth, to ſhewe to vs, your poore ſubiectes: wee moſte humblie beſeche you, to bee ſo gracious, as to take in hande, the knowledge of the cauſe, by whiche (beyng daily purſued to death, or baniſhemente) wee loſe the power and meane, to ſhewe to you that moſt humble ſeruice, whiche of duetie wee owe. Maie it therfore pleaſe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, in ſtede of fire and ſweard, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore vſed, to examine our Confeſſion by the worde of God, and to graunt vs ſufferaunce and ſauetie in the meane while.

ſelf ſhall iudge of our innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, &amp; well perceiue, that there is neither hereſie, nor rebellion in vs: but that we onely tende to this ende, to liue in quietneſſe of conſcience, ſerue God as he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, and to obeye your Maieſtie in all humble obedience and ſeruice. And bicauſe the preaching of the word of God, is neceſſarie to putte vs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce, as wel of our duetie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes hym, as towardes you: wee moſte humbly beſeche your Maieſtie, that we maie ſometymes gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be exhorted to the feare of God by his woorde, and confirmed by the adminiſtracion of the Sacramentes, whiche our Sauiour Chriſte hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincted to his church. And if it would pleaſe you, to graunte vs ſome open place, where all the worlde might ſee our aſſemblies, that onely ſight ſhould diſcharge vs of thoſe hainous crimes, that heretofore our ſaid aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies haue been charged withall. For, there is nought to been, but modeſtie and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, nought to be heard, but praiſe to God, exhortacion to his ſeruice, and
<pb facs="tcp:18639:144"/>
praier for the conſeruacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie and kyngdome. And if it pleaſe not your grace, to ſhew vs this fauor, yet maie it pleaſe you at the leaſte, to graunte, that wee maie particularly vſe that quiet order, whiche is eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Moſte humblie beſechyng your Maieſtie, in readyng this preſent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicacion, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, that it is the cries and groaries, of an infinite nomber of your poore ſubiectes, whiche craue ſuche mercie at your handes, that it maie quenche the fires, that your cruel Iudges haue kindled in your realme. And ſo, that hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blie ſeruyng your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, wee maie lawfully ſerue hym, that hath exalted your highnes to this dignitie and ſtate. And if ye refuſe to beare vs, yet maie pleaſe you to heare the voice of the ſonne of God, who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng you power ouer oure bodies, goodes, &amp; liues, requireth of you, that the power and gouernment ouer our ſoules and conſciences (whiche he ſo dearely bought, by the price of his hart bloud) ſhould be reſerued to hym one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The ſame God we beſeche to guide
